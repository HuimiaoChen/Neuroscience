# Why I decided to pursue research in neuroscience?

1. I have always been passionate about natural sciences. ISince elementary school, I participated in mathematical Olympiads and later, in middle school, I began studying for physics Olympiads. When I was a high school student, I was fortunate to be selected for the Zhejiang provincial team in the Chinese Physics Olympiad. Despite not continuing my studies in these subjects in college, my love for natural sciences persisted. While I can't directly switch to physics or math, I find neuroscience to be a closely related discipline. I hope to take this opportunity to return to the field of natural sciences. I recall a saying: "Physics is the most interesting thing in the world, followed by neuroscience."
2. I had experience in electromyography (EMG) signal recognition. This experience introduced me to neuroscience and gradually deepened my interest in the field. I realized that neuroscience, as a foundational science, has a wide range of practical applications.
3. I had experience in deep learning and computer vision. This background provided me with a solid foundation in computational methods, applicable to the study of neuroscience. I am eager to leverage my knowledge and skills in these areas to better understand the intricacies of the brain and contribute to the advancement of the field.
4. I began to ponder philosophical questions. At one point, I lost a significant amount of money in investments, which led me to contemplate philosophical issues and even brought me close to depression. Gradually, I discovered that I could only explore philosophy through science, and neuroscience and physics emerged as the most promising disciplines to take me there. Neuroscience is currently more feasible for me, and it will, along with philosophy, become my lifelong pursuit.
5. I am fortunate to be financially stable, allowing me to dedicate my time and efforts to long-term scientific research. Having been involved in entrepreneurship and some profitable work during the tumultuous years of China's capital market, I now feel it is time to wholeheartedly return to research. If I'm not focused on financial pursuits, I will instead dedicate myself to advancing the frontiers of science.
6. I believe that humanity is on the cusp of entering the era of intelligence. Neuroscience and artificial intelligence will play critical roles in unlocking this new age. Before intelligence surpasses the human brain, this is the final moment for the human brain as an intellectual worker, and I am eager to be a part of this exciting journey.
